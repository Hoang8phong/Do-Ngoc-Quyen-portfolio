        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my commission services! <span>Please read carefully before ordering.</span> By commissioning artwork from me, you agree to the following terms and conditions:</p>

        <h3>1. Commission Process</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All commissions must be requested through the provided commission form or message on Facebook.</li>
            <li>I reserve the right to accept or decline any commission request at my discretion. Please always credit Quyen (nickname) </li>
            <li>50% or 100% payment upfront is required before I start working. The remaining amount (if any) must be paid before I continue with the final stage. </li>
            <li>Payment is required in advance to secure a slot in the queue. However, if you decide to cancel, the deposit will not be refunded.</li>
            <li>Payment is only accepted via PayPal.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Artwork Usage</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The commissioned artwork is for personal use only and may not be resold or used for commercial purposes without my explicit permission.</li>
            <li>I retain the right to use the commissioned artwork for promotional purposes, including but not limited to social media, portfolio, and website display.</li>
            <li>You may share the commissioned artwork on social media, provided that proper credit is given to me as the artist.</li>
            <li>Do not use it to train AI.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Revisions and Changes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Please list all revision requests at once to avoid unnecessary back-and-forth.</li>
            <li>Major changes or additional revisions may incur extra fees.</li>
            <li>Revisions must be requested during the sketch phase. Once the final artwork is delivered, no further changes will be made without additional charges.</li>
            <li>No extra fee for revisions before a stage is finalized. After finalizing a stage, any further changes may require an additional fee depending on the complexity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Delivery and Timeline</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The estimated timeline for completing a commission will be provided upon acceptance of the request. However, this timeline may vary based on workload and complexity of the artwork.</li>
            <li>I will start working  on the commission when it is your turn, not immediately after payment.  The waiting time depends on my current queue, so please be patient.</li>
            <li>I will communicate any delays or changes in the timeline promptly.</li>
            
            <li>Final artwork will be delivered</li>
